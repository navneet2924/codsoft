## What it is

A basic warmup exercise. Simple, practice oriented, clone of the Netflix Homepage. Built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- [Awesomeness](https://www.wikihow.com/Love-Programming) - Strictly for the love of coding :-)

## What it does

- Look pretty, that's about it :-)

## Learning Points

- CSS Grid
- Styling Tables
- Positioning

## Some cool stuff

Usually, people tend to run to CSS Frameworks to develop and style tabs and switching tabs. 



## Features in Development

I might add the other pages on the Netflix website if I ever come back to refactor ^-^

## Contribution

Contributions are highly welcome. Feel free to fork, clone, make pull requests, report issues etc.
